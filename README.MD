## Why Contribute
To Improve your skill, learn a new one or just to help the community. ❤

## Before You Start / Project Guidelines
* See the project [issues](https://github.com/rsaz/mankind/issues) to implement or suggest a new feature.
* If you need any extra information, feel free to contact us in the discord channel.

## Unity Version
For this project, we will use **Unity 2019.4 LTS**, whatever the latest patch version is. 

## Things not allowed
There are a number of things we disallow or discourage, in order to keep the project organised and fun for everyone.

Please:
* Don’t update the version of Unity.
* Don’t add a new package to the project.
* Don’t update a package that is being used by the project.
* Don’t delete assets or scenes that are not strictly related to your contribution. Refactoring (renaming, moving) them is ok.
* Don’t add testing scenes, testing scripts, and in general assets that you should keep to yourself. Use them to test/prototype, and then exclude them when you push.

Any of these rules can be “broken” if there is a reason. Please discuss on the forums explaining why you think you need (e.g.) to add a new package, update one, etc.

## In any case, absolutely:
* **Do not** add any kind of profanity, obscene content, or text or graphics that can be offensive to others.
* **Do not** contribute anything that is not your own creation. No models ripped from other games, no textures taken from the web, no royalty-free audio (unless you made it), no stolen bits of code (unless they are “open” and come with an open source license themselves).
* **Don’t** make a PR just to make one (i.e. you are testing things, or participating in a contest).

If you do any of the above, we reserve the right to ban you from contributing to the project any further. In case of doubt regarding intellectual property, ask first on the forums.
